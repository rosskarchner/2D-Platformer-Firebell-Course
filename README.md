# 2D-Platformer-Firebelly-Course
Built while following [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/create-a-complete-2d-platformer-in-the-godot-engine/), with some adjustments:
- Using Godot 4, instead of Godot 3. In some places, this meant different names for things, different approaches to achieving a similar result, and in one case, I was able to use Godot 4's default CharachterBody2D script instead of writing the code the tutorial asks for.
- Some gameplay tweaks (including a new enemy!) suggested by my son
